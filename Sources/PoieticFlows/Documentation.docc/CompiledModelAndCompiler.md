# Compiled Model and Compiler

Compiler creates a compiled model, which is an internal representation of
a design that can be simulated.

## Overview

A design represents user's idea, user's creation. To be able to perform the
computation, the design has to be validated and converted into a
representation understandable by a simulator. That conversion is done by
the compiler.
